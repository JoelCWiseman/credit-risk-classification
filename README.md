The purpose of this analysis is to develop a machine-learning model for credit risk assessment, with the goal of a predictive model capable of distinguishing between healthy loans (label 0) and high-risk loans (label 1) based on relevant data points. This model would then be able to automate part of the credit risk analysis process.

Here are the key performance metrics of the machine learning model.  The Accuracy Score, In the first analysis (without oversampling), the model achieved a balanced accuracy score of 0.952. In the second analysis (with oversampling), the model achieved a higher balanced accuracy score of 0.994.  Precision Score, For healthy loans (label 0), the precision was perfect (1.00) in both analyses. For high-risk loans (label 1), precision was 0.85 in the first analysis and 0.84 in the second analysis.  Recall Score, For healthy loans (label 0), the recall was 0.99 in both analyses.	For high-risk loans (label 1), the recall was 0.91 in the first analysis and 0.99 in the second analysis.

In summary, the machine learning model has demonstrated high performance in predicting credit risk for both healthy and high-risk loans by exhibiting high accuracy, with balanced accuracy scores of 0.952 and 0.994, respectively, indicating its ability to correctly classify loans.

For healthy loans (label 0), the model consistently achieved perfect precision and very high recall, indicating its precision in identifying loans that are genuinely healthy while capturing the vast majority of these loans.

For high-risk loans (label 1), the model performed very well, with a good balance between precision and recall. It effectively identified high-risk loans, minimizing false positives and capturing the majority of actual high-risk loans.

Recommendation: I would recommend the use of the machine learning model fitted with oversampled data. It demonstrated superior performance with a balanced accuracy score of 0.994, providing highly accurate predictions for both healthy and high-risk loans. The model's ability to maintain high precision and recall for both classes is ideal for completing a credit risk assessment, helping the company minimize risks.

The model's robustness, especially in correctly identifying high-risk loans, makes it a valuable tool for the company's credit risk assessment process. Its use can lead to more informed lending decisions, reducing the risk inherent to high-risk loans.
